# Comet Integration

The following functions help in integrating Comet.ml with your reinforcement learning project for experimentation, logging, visualization, and interaction through a Streamlit app.

## Functions

### initialize_experiment(api_key, project_name)

Initialize a Comet experiment with the given API key and project name. It returns the created experiment object.

### log_hyperparameters(experiment, hyperparameters)

Log hyperparameters to the given experiment object.

### log_metrics(experiment, metrics)

Log performance metrics (e.g., rewards, losses) to the given experiment object.

### log_episode(experiment, episode, metrics)

Log an entire episode's metrics (e.g., rewards, losses) to the given experiment object.

### upload_model_weights(experiment, model_filepath)

Upload the model weights to the given experiment object.

### end_experiment(experiment)

End the given experiment and close the connection to Comet.

### get_experiment_data(experiment_key)

Retrieve the data (e.g., metrics, hyperparameters) for a specific experiment using its experiment key.

### plot_experiment_metrics(experiment_data)

Visualize the experiment data (e.g., rewards, losses) using a plotting library like Plotly.

### streamlit_comet_interaction(api_key, project_name)

Integrate Comet with a Streamlit app, allowing users to interact with the experiments data.
