## Agent Descriptions

- **RandomAgent**: An agent that selects actions randomly without learning from the environment.
- **QLAgent**: A Q-Learning agent that learns to select actions based on estimates of state-action values.
- **DQNAgent**: A Deep Q-Network agent that uses a neural network to approximate state-action values.
- **PPOAgent**: A Proximal Policy Optimization agent that optimizes a policy using a surrogate objective function.
- **PGAgent**: A Policy Gradient agent that learns a parameterized policy by estimating gradients of expected rewards.
- **DDPGAgent**: A Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient agent that combines deep learning and policy gradient methods for continuous control.
- **A2CAgent**: An Advantage Actor-Critic agent that uses separate neural networks for policy and value functions.
- **SACAgent**: A Soft Actor-Critic agent that learns a stochastic policy for continuous control tasks using a maximum entropy framework
