Add support for interactive plotting:
You can use Altair, Plotly, or another supported library for creating interactive plots in the "Demonstrations" and "Gallery" sections. This will help users explore the data more easily and provide a better understanding of the agents' performance.

Error handling:
Add error handling in case the selected agent or environment is not available or fails to load. Display an error message to the user with instructions on how to proceed.

Add tooltips to widgets:
Adding tooltips to the widgets in the sidebar can help users understand the purpose of each option better. Use the st.beta_expander function to provide additional information about each widget when clicked.

Add a progress bar:
While running demonstrations, testing, or training agents, display a progress bar to indicate the progress of the task. This will help users understand how long the process will take and provide a better user experience.

Documentation:
Consider adding more detailed descriptions of each agent and environment in the "Agent and Environment Descriptions" section. You can create separate markdown files for each agent and environment and load them dynamically based on user selections.
