Add support for interactive plotting:
You can use Altair, Plotly, or another supported library for creating interactive plots in the "Demonstrations" and "Gallery" sections. This will help users explore the data more easily and provide a better understanding of the agents' performance.

Error handling:
Add error handling in case the selected agent or environment is not available or fails to load. Display an error message to the user with instructions on how to proceed.

Add tooltips to widgets:
Adding tooltips to the widgets in the sidebar can help users understand the purpose of each option better. Use the st.beta_expander function to provide additional information about each widget when clicked.

Add a progress bar:
While running demonstrations, testing, or training agents, display a progress bar to indicate the progress of the task. This will help users understand how long the process will take and provide a better user experience.

Documentation:
Consider adding more detailed descriptions of each agent and environment in the "Agent and Environment Descriptions" section. You can create separate markdown files for each agent and environment and load them dynamically based on user selections.

Add a visualization of the agent's training progress in the Interactive Environment page. This can include episode rewards over time, steps taken, and other relevant metrics.

Implement a method to save and load trained agents, allowing users to resume training or use pre-trained agents in the Interactive Environment.

Allow users to modify agent hyperparameters and environment settings before running a demonstration or starting the Interactive Environment.

Integrate more reinforcement learning algorithms and environments to provide a broader range of learning experiences.

Add an advanced mode for experienced users, where they can modify the agent's code or create their own agents and environments directly in the app.

Provide detailed explanations and visualizations of the inner workings of each reinforcement learning algorithm, such as Q-tables and policy networks.

Implement a leaderboard feature that allows users to compare the performance of their agents against others.

Refactor the code: Organize the code into smaller, more manageable files, and separate the logic for agents, environments, and demonstrations into their respective modules.

Implement additional agents and environments: Add more reinforcement learning agents and environments to showcase various learning algorithms and compare their performances.

Improve user experience: Enhance the user interface by using Streamlit components like sliders, dropdowns, and buttons for better interactivity. Use Streamlit's layout features to create a more organized and visually appealing app.

Add performance metrics: Implement performance metrics to evaluate the performance of different agents in different environments. Display these metrics as graphs or tables for easy comparison.

Document the code: Write clear and concise documentation for each function and module, explaining their purpose and usage. This will help other developers understand and contribute to the project.

Testing: Write comprehensive test cases for different parts of the app, covering various scenarios and edge cases. This will help ensure the app's reliability and maintainability.

Deployment: Deploy the app on a platform like Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, or AWS, allowing users to access and interact with the app easily.

Continuous integration and delivery: Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, building, and deploying the app whenever changes are made to the codebase. This will help ensure the app stays up-to-date and minimizes potential issues.
